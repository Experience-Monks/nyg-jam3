# Contributing with the Jam3 Generator

Thinking about get involve with the generator? Thanks!.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate the core ideas and the purpose of the project. Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Core Ideas

The generator structure is based on the same idea than [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). We created a full boilerplate and we are using `react-scripts` to run our development server and create the build.

We are using [react-scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/next/packages/react-scripts) because is fully supported by the community and includes the best and updated react standards. In order to customize it we decided **not** to eject and we are using [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired).

The purpose of this tool is to generate an opinionated template with the Jam3's standards and best practices. This template doesn't have configurations or prompts.

We included in the project the common used components and structure, it doesn't mean you need to use all of them and in that case our strategy is to delete it instead of having a massive configuration file with many cases, usually hardly to maintain.

### Convention

Instead of letting the user specify the entry filename, we always assume it to be `src/index.js`. Rather than letting the user specify the output bundle name, we generate it, but make sure to include the content hash in it. Whenever possible, we want to leverage convention to make good choices for the user, especially in cases where itâ€™s easy to misconfigure something.

### Interactivity

One of the core ideas is to create a project template easy to maintain, one of the ways to acchieve it is to reduce the amount of variable replacements when the project is being generated.

This project is using `nyg` and it provides ways to add prompts, however we are trying to avoid any kind of prompt at least is very important and won't affect the maintenance of the project.

### Breaking the Rules

No rules are perfect. Sometimes we may introduce flags or configuration if we believe the value is high enough to justify the mental cost. For example, we know that apps may be hosted paths different from the root, and we need to support this use case. However, we still try to fall back to heuristics when possible. In this example, we ask that you specify `homepage` in `package.json`, and infer the correct path based on it. We also nudge the user to fill out the `homepage` after the build, so the user becomes aware that the feature exists.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Good pull requests, such as patches, improvements, and new features, are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Please **ask first** if somebody else is already working on this or the core developers think your feature is in-scope for Create React App. Generally always have a related issue with discussions for whatever you are including.

Once you know you are the only one working on this, please assign the issue to yourself.

Please also provide a **test plan**, i.e. specify how you verified that your addition works.

## Folder Structure

* `templates`: It has exactly the app that will be generated
* `test`: After run `npm test` it will generate the app inside `output`

### Overview of root directory

The entry point of the generator is `index.js`, this file is in charge of:

1.  Copy the `templates` into the output directory
2.  Runs `npm install` once copied all the files
3.  Runs the post-installs tasks
    1.  Update the node version inside `.nvmrc`

## Setting Up a Local Copy

1.  Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/Jam3/generator-jam3-v2.git`
2.  Here you can start contributing with:
    1.  The generator, modifing the `index.js`
    2.  The template that will be generated inside `templates/*`

## Test your changes

### I've changed the templates content

Because the whole template is self-contained in the `templates` folder, you have total control over it.

You can run the project using `npm start` or if you wanna try the build, run `npm run build`

### I've changed the generator builder

To try the whole generator installation, exactly how will happen when the users execute it run `npm test`. You can find the generated project in `test/output`
