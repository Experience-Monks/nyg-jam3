If you application should be fully controlled from some files or will fetch all the data from a future endpoint that is in development right now, add all your data inside this folder.

Have the content centralized here will help to maintain copies and migrate to future solutions like endpoints.

Note:
Have it here doesn't mean you can not modularize the data per section, feels free to spread the data.json(s).
